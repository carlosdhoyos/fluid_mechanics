# Welcome to the Fluid Mechanics Course Site

My name is **Carlos D. Hoyos**, and I am an associate professor at the **Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Facultad de Minas, Sede Medellín, Departamento de Geociencias y Medioambiente**. I have a **Ph.D. in Earth and Atmospheric Sciences from Georgia Institute of Technology**, along with a **Masters in Oceanic and Atmospheric Sciences**, a **Masters in Water Resources**, and a **Civil Engineering degree**. My work has taken me through diverse fields—studying the behavior of the **atmosphere**, understanding **water resources**, and applying **data science** to solve problems related to agriculture, energy, risk management, and climate. Fluid dynamics has been a common thread throughout my career, from analyzing **atmospheric circulations** that drive global climate patterns to modeling **river flows** that sustain ecosystems and cities. This course gives me the opportunity to share not only the fundamental concepts of fluid mechanics but also some of their applications. 

I am committed to building a set of online course materials to complement our in-class lectures. This content is made accessible through Jupyter Books hosted on GitHub, providing you with dynamic, interactive, and up-to-date resources for your studies.


## The Importance of Fluid Mechanics

Fluid mechanics is not just a core subject within engineering; it’s the backbone of many fields that influence our daily lives. It explains how **blood circulates in the human body**, where advanced [simulations of vascular flows](https://www.manchester.ac.uk/about/news/research-progress-reveals-faster-more-accurate-blood-flow-simulation-to-revolutionise-treatment-of-vascular-diseases/) are improving medical treatments (Figure 1). It underpins technologies such as [fluid flow in pipes](https://pressbooks.online.ucf.edu/osuniversityphysics/chapter/14-5-fluid-dynamics/) (Figure 2), [valve and CFD simulations](https://www.savener.es/en/featured-news/savener-expands-its-expertise-in-fluid-dynamics-cfd%EF%BF%BC/) (Figure 3), and [mine ventilation systems](https://www.mdpi.com/1996-1073/15/22/8405) (Figure 4).  

From an engineering perspective, fluid mechanics plays a crucial role in **energy systems**, where it helps design more efficient turbines, optimize hydraulic systems, and improve aerodynamics in transportation. In renewable energy, it drives advances in [hydropower generation](https://www.usgs.gov/media/images/flow-water-produces-hydroelectricity) (Figure 5), [engineering applications of hydropower](https://fluids.umn.edu/research/engineering-applications/hydropower) (Figure 6), and [wind turbine rotor simulations](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/we.2639) (Figure 7). In aerospace, understanding the [flow of air over wings](https://eaglepubs.erau.edu/introductiontoaerospaceflightvehicles/chapter/what-is-aerospace-engineering/) is critical to flight (Figure 8).  


### Fluid Mechanics and Climate Science

While we often associate fluid mechanics with mechanical and civil engineering, its relevance to **climate science** cannot be overstated. Fluid behavior in the atmosphere and oceans dictates weather patterns, the distribution of heat and moisture across the planet, and even how pollutants disperse. As the climate changes, fluid mechanics becomes crucial in modeling these evolving dynamics and predicting their impacts on both natural and human systems.  

On a global scale, fluid mechanics governs **large-scale circulation systems** such as [river flows](https://progearthplanetsci.springeropen.com/articles/10.1186/s40645-018-0208-3) (Figure 9), [ocean currents](https://sos.noaa.gov/catalog/datasets/ocean-circulation-labeled-currents/) (Figure 10), [atmospheric circulation](https://www.rmets.org/metmatters/global-atmospheric-circulation) (Figure 11), and even [hurricanes](https://gpm.nasa.gov/data/art-creating-digital-hurricanes) (Figure 12). These systems, in turn, shape **local weather patterns**, **long-term climate trends**, and critical sectors such as agriculture, ecosystems, and energy generation.  

For example, **wind energy** relies directly on our ability to model how air moves across landscapes (Figure 7). In **solar energy**, fluid dynamics improves the cooling systems of solar panels and optimizes the airflow across large solar farms. Moreover, **climate resilience**—a pressing issue as we face more extreme weather events—benefits directly from fluid mechanics through flood control, stormwater management, and the prediction of hurricane or typhoon dynamics.  

### Small-Scale Applications: From Biomedical Engineering to Household Technologies

While climate science deals with global fluid systems, the principles of fluid mechanics also apply at much smaller scales. **Biomedical engineering** is a field that deeply integrates fluid dynamics to design medical devices, simulate blood flow, and develop life-saving technologies. Engineers use fluid mechanics to understand how the heart pumps blood, how artificial valves can mimic natural flow, and how drugs can be delivered through targeted microfluidic channels (Figure 1).  

Even in everyday household technologies, fluid mechanics plays a role—whether it’s the way a **showerhead** disperses water efficiently, how a **vacuum cleaner** generates suction, or how [surface tension](https://fluid-dynamics.leeds.ac.uk/research/outreach/learn-more-about-fluid-dynamics/surface-tension/) (Figure 13) shapes the behavior of water droplets. These seemingly simple systems are based on the same complex principles we study in this course.  

### Beyond Engineering: Sports and Performance

Fluid mechanics even reaches into **sports and performance**, such as optimizing [aerodynamics in motorsport](https://www.racecar-engineering.com/advertisement/fluid-dynamics-in-motorsport/) (Figure 14). Athletes, race car engineers, and designers alike benefit from fluid dynamic principles to reduce drag, increase efficiency, and enhance performance.  


Ultimately, understanding fluid mechanics empowers us to address challenges at every scale—from **global circulation systems** that shape climate, to **engineering innovations** that drive renewable energy, to **microscale biomedical devices** that save lives. It is a universal toolkit for solving problems that connect physics, engineering, the environment, and human health.
