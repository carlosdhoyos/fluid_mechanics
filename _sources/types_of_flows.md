# Types of Fluid Flow

Fluids exhibit different types of flow depending on various factors like velocity, pressure, and external forces. The major types of fluid flow are:

1. **Laminar Flow**: Flow where fluid moves in smooth paths or layers.
2. **Turbulent Flow**: Flow where the fluid undergoes irregular fluctuations and mixing.
3. **Steady Flow**: The fluid properties at any point remain constant over time.
4. **Unsteady Flow**: The fluid properties change over time.
