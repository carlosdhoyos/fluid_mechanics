## Overview
Fluid kinematics deals with the description of fluid motion without considering the forces that cause it.  
Key ideas include the velocity field, acceleration, vorticity, and flow visualization tools such as streamlines and pathlines.

## Topics to Cover
- Lagrangian vs. Eulerian descriptions
- Velocity and acceleration fields
- Vorticity and circulation
- Streamlines, pathlines, streaklines
- Velocity potential and stream function
- Rotational vs. irrotational flows
- Incompressible vs. compressible flows

## Applications
- Visualizing flows in wind tunnels
- Tracer particles in experiments
- Computational fluid dynamics (CFD) post-processing
