# Syllabus
**Course Duration**: 16 Weeks

## Course Description
This course introduces the fundamental principles of fluid mechanics, focusing on the behavior of incompressible fluids. Topics include fluid statics, kinematics, and dynamics, with an emphasis on differential analysis, including the Navier-Stokes equations and Bernoulli's equation. Students will apply these principles to solve practical engineering problems.
