# Pressure Measurement Using Hydrostatic Balance

## Introduction

Pressure measurement is a fundamental aspect of fluid mechanics, essential for understanding and controlling fluid behavior in engineering applications. Instruments like barometers, piezometers, and manometers rely on the principles of hydrostatic balance to measure fluid pressure accurately.

Hydrostatic balance is described by the equation:

$$
\frac{\partial p}{\partial z} = -\rho g
$$

This relationship governs the variation of pressure with height in a fluid at rest. By integrating it, we obtain:

$$
p = p_0 + \rho g h
$$

where:
- $p_0$ is the reference pressure,
- $\rho$ is the fluid density,
- $g$ is the acceleration due to gravity,
- $h$ is the height of the fluid column.

This principle forms the basis for several devices used to measure pressure. Below, we discuss these devices with practical examples.

## 1. The Barometer

### Description

The barometer is used to measure atmospheric pressure. It typically consists of a vertical tube filled with a liquid (commonly mercury) inverted in an open reservoir. The height of the mercury column represents the atmospheric pressure:

$$
p_{\text{atm}} = \rho g h
$$

### Example

- **Mercury Barometer**: If the height of the mercury column is 760 mm, and the density of mercury is $13,600 \, \text{kg/m}^3$, the atmospheric pressure is:
  $$
  p_{\text{atm}} = (13,600 \, \text{kg/m}^3)(9.81 \, \text{m/s}^2)(0.76 \, \text{m})
  $$
  which calculates to approximately $101,325 \, \text{Pa}$ (standard atmospheric pressure).

## 2. The Piezometer

### Description

A piezometer is a simple device for measuring the pressure of a liquid in a pipe. It consists of a transparent tube inserted vertically into the pipe. The height of the liquid column in the tube indicates the pressure:

$$
p = \rho g h
$$

### Example

- **Water Pipe**: If the water column in a piezometer rises to 2 m and the density of water is $1000 \, \text{kg/m}^3$:
  $$
  p = (1000)(9.81)(2) = 19,620 \, \text{Pa}
  $$

## 3. The U-Tube Manometer

### Description

The U-tube manometer measures pressure differences by comparing liquid heights in a U-shaped tube. A fluid of known density is placed in the tube, and pressure is related to the height difference:

$$
\Delta p = \rho g \Delta h
$$

### Example

- **Gas Pressure Measurement**: If one side of the manometer shows a fluid height difference of 0.5 m using mercury:
  $$
  \Delta p = (13,600)(9.81)(0.5) = 66,660 \, \text{Pa}
  $$

## 4. The Inclined Manometer

### Description

An inclined manometer enhances sensitivity for small pressure differences by tilting the tube. The length of the liquid column along the incline is related to the pressure:

$$
\Delta p = \rho g h \sin \theta
$$

where $\theta$ is the angle of inclination.

### Example

- **Small Pressure Difference**: For an inclined manometer with a fluid column length of 1 m at an angle $\theta = 30^\circ$ and mercury:
  $$
  \Delta p = (13,600)(9.81)(1)(\sin 30^\circ) = 66,660 \, \text{Pa}
  $$

## 5. Other Devices

### a. **Bourdon Tube**
- Measures pressure using the deformation of a curved, flexible tube under pressure.
- Example: Used in industrial pressure gauges.

### b. **Pressure Transducer**
- Converts pressure into an electrical signal for digital applications.
- Example: Automotive sensors for monitoring engine oil pressure.

### c. **Differential Manometer**
- Used to measure pressure differences between two points in a system.
