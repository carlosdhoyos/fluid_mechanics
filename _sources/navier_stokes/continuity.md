# Conservation of Mass (Continuity Equation)

The continuity equation expresses the conservation of mass in the fluid, ensuring that mass cannot be created or destroyed:

$$
\frac{\partial \rho}{\partial t} + \nabla \cdot (\rho \mathbf{V}) = 0
$$

where:
- $ \rho $ is the fluid density,
- $ \mathbf{V} $ is the velocity vector of the fluid, and
- $ t $ is time.

In incompressible flows, where $ \rho $ is constant, this simplifies to:

$$
\nabla \cdot \mathbf{V} = 0
$$
